# Wordpress to Statamic

Within this repository I am trying to find a sweet way to move away from Wordpress, and find a good steady solution in Statamic.

## Introduction
To be honest, Wordpress works great if you have clients with a small budget. You can set up the website in minutes with the right set of plugins. When building a webshop, WooCommerce is your friend. As a developer, I feel bad about using this tools. As a business man, I am happy with this kind of tools. 

My developer-heart is at its best when I am building web applications in Laravel. Finally I can code, type hint, test whatever I want. Content and logic is completely separated. I love it. Wordpress puts content and logic in the blender, and there you'll have your website. Hard to scale, hard to extend (by code), hard to do version control.

My main question in this search is:

> How can we move from Wordpress to Statamic, and how can we solve the common problems?

Sub-questions I'll try to answer:

1. How do you manage content in Statamic?
2. How do you design in Statamic?
3. How do you split data (users, orders) and semi-data (blog content)?
4. How do you host Statamic?
5. How much time does it take to develop feature X from Wordpress / WooCommerce?
6. How can we combine the best of Laravel and Statamic together to create webshops?
7. How can we manage multilingual sites?
8. How can we test our websites / Statamic parts?

## File structure
In this readme you'll find and overview of this repo. Each chapter handles one of the questions above. Those are separate markdown files.

## To be continued
I need to go to an appointment, see you later!
